# QR-CODES-BASED-RECEIPT-MANAGEMENT-STRATEGY.
This is android based project in which a QR code based receipt is generated by the retailers while a customer is buying the product. The customer then scan the QR code on the receipt with this application, which saves the details that are provided by that QR code regarding the product, date it is bought etc. thus the customer need not maintain the paper receipts anymore and can use this application as their receipt manager. These application is very much used when the customer lose his receipt and want to claim for maintenance services and exchanges. The retailer also can scan the QR code on the receipt to check whether the customer is eligible to avail the requested services.  The retailers create the QR code based on product information, customer information, and date of buying etc which will be stored in his database. The moment he scans the QR code, he get all the information and thus verifies it against his database. Thus the system makes receipt management easy and handy.
